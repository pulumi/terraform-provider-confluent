`confluent_stream_governance_cluster` describes a Stream Governance cluster data source.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "confluent_stream_governance_cluster" "example_using_id" {
  id = "lsrc-abc123"
  environment {
    id = "env-xyz456"
  }
}

output "example_using_id" {
  value = data.confluent_stream_governance_cluster.example_using_id
}

data "confluent_stream_governance_cluster" "example_using_name" {
  display_name = "Stream Governance Package"
  environment {
    id = "env-xyz456"
